# Expo Camera Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: a TypeError resulting from attempting to access `cameraRef.current` before the camera has fully initialized. The solution provides a robust approach to handle this asynchronous initialization.

## Problem

The `cameraRef` object within a functional component using Expo's Camera API might not be immediately populated. Accessing `cameraRef.current` before the camera is ready results in a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'current')`.

## Solution

The solution leverages the `useEffect` hook to asynchronously wait for the camera to initialize before accessing its properties.  This is essential for a smooth and error-free user experience.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
4. Observe the console and the application behavior to understand the error and its solution.
